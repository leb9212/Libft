# Libft

### What is Libft?
Libft is a lightweight C library written from scratch to help C development easier. <br>
It contains numerous re-implementations of standard library functions as well as essential data structure and their functionalities. <br>

### Key Features
1. Various sorting algorithms for strings/integers (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, bubblesort, insertionsort)
2. Re-implemented printf. Supports hh, h , l, ll, j, z modifiers, [diouxXDOUeEfFgGaAcCsSpn%] specifiers, and #, 0, -, ' '(space), + flags.
3. get_next_line function that reads one line at a time from a file descriptor.
3. Various data structures (singly linked list, doubly linked list, stack, binary tree).
4. Many standard C library functions.

### To do list
1. Add more data types (queue, priority queue, heaps, n-ary tree, trie, etc).
2. Implement scanf-like function.
